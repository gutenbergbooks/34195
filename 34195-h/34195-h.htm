      <p class="hg3">"This is the Jew</p>
      <p>That Shakspeare drew."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I do not know by whom or when the above couplet was first imputed to
  Pope. The following extracts will show how a story grows, and the
  parasites which, under unwholesome cultivation, adhere to it. The
  restoration of Shakspeare's text, and the performance of Shylock as a
  serious part, are told as usual.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the dumb action of the trial scene he was amazingly descriptive,
  and through the whole displayed such unequalled merit, as justly entitled
  him to that very comprehensive, though concise, compliment paid to him by
  Mr. Pope, who sat in the stage-box on the third night of the
  reproduction, and who emphatically exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'This is the Jew</p>
      <p>That Shakspeare drew.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Life of Macklin</i>, by J. T. Kirkman, vol. i. p. 264.: London,
  1799, 2 vols. 8vo.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The book is ill-written, and no authorities are cited.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A few days after, Macklin received an invitation to dine with Lord
  Bolingbroke at Battersea. He attended the rendezvous, and there found
  Pope and a select party, who complimented him very much on the part of
  Shylock, and questioned him about many little particulars, relative to
  his getting up the play, &amp;c. Pope particularly asked him why he wore
  a <i>red hat</i>, and he answered, because he had read that Jews in
  Italy, particularly in Venice, wore hats of that colour.</p>

  <p>'And pray, Mr. Macklin,' said Pope, 'do players in general take such
  pains?' 'I do not know, sir, that they do; but as I had staked my
  reputation on the character, I was determined to spare no trouble in
  getting at the best information.' Pope nodded, and said, 'It was very
  laudable.'"&mdash;<i>Memoirs of Macklin</i>, p. 94., Lond. 1804.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The above work has not the author's name, and is as defective in
  references as Mr. Kirkman's. It is, however, not quite so trashy. Being
  published five years later, the author must have seen the preceding
  <i>Life</i>, and his not repeating the story about the couplet is strong
  presumption that it was not then believed. It appears again in the
  <i>Biographia Dramatica</i>, vol. i. p. 469., London, 1812:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Macklin's performance of this character (Shylock) so forcibly struck
  a gentleman in the pit, that he as it were involuntarily exclaimed, 'This
  is,' &amp;c. It has been said that this gentleman was Mr. Pope."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I am not aware of its alteration during the next forty years, but this
  was the state of the anecdote in 1853:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Macklin was a tragedian, and the personal friend of Alexander Pope.
  He had a daughter, a beautiful and accomplished girl, who was likewise on
  the stage. On one occasion Macklin's daughter was about to take a benefit
  at Drury Lane Theatre, and on the morning of that evening, whilst the
  father and daughter were at breakfast, a young nobleman entered the
  apartment, and, with the most undisguised ruffianism, made overtures of a
  dishonourable character to Macklin for his daughter. The exasperated
  father, seizing a knife from the table, rushed at the fellow, who on the
  instant fled, on which Macklin pursued him along the street with the
  knife in his hand. The cause of the tragedian's wild appearance in the
  street soon got vent in the city. Evening came, and Old Drury seldom saw
  so crowded a house. The play was the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>, Macklin
  sustaining the part of Shylock, and his interesting daughter that of
  Jessica. Their reception was most enthusiastic; but in that scene where
  the Jew is informed of his daughter being carried off, the whole audience
  seemed to be quite carried away by Macklin's acting. The applause was
  immense, and Pope, who was standing in the pit, exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'That's the Jew that Shakspeare drew.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Macklin was much respected in London. He was a native of Monaghan, and
  a Protestant. His father was a Catholic, and died when he was a child;
  and his mother being a Protestant, he was educated as
  such."&mdash;<i>Dublin Weekly Telegraph</i>, Feb. 9, 1853.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>One more version is given in the <i>Irish Quarterly Review</i>, and
  quoted approvingly in <i>The Leader</i>, Dec. 17, 1853.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The house was crowded from the opening of the doors, and the curtain
  rose amidst the most dreadful of all awful silence, the stillness of a
  multitude. The Jew enters in the third scene, and from that point, to the
  famous scene with Tubal, all passed off with considerable applause. Here,
  however, and in the trial scene, the actor was triumphant, and in the
  applause of a thousand voices the curtain dropped. The play was repeated
  for nineteen successive nights with increased success. On the third night
  of representation all eyes were directed to the stage-box, where sat a
  little deformed man; and whilst others watched <i>his</i> gestures, as if
  to learn his opinion of the performers, he was gazing intently upon
  Shylock, and as the actor panted, in broken accents of rage, and sorrow,
  and avarice&mdash;'Go, Tubal, fee me an officer, bespeak him a fortnight
  before: I will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for were he out of
  Venice, I can make what merchandise I will: go, Tubal, and meet me at our
  synagogue; go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.'&mdash;the little man
  was seen to rise, and leaning from the box, as Macklin passed it, he
  whispered,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'This is the Jew,</p>
      <p>That Shakspeare drew.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The speaker was Alexander Pope, and, in that age, from his judgment in
  criticism there was no appeal."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 240 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page240"></a>{240}</span></p>

  <p>No reference to cotemporary testimony is given by these
  historians.</p>

  <p>Galt, in his <i>Lives of the Players</i>, Lond. 1831, does not notice
  the story.</p>

  <p>Pope was at Bath on the 4th of February, 1741, as appears from his
  letter to Warburton of that date; but as he mentions his intention to
  return to London, he may have been there on the 14th. That he was not in
  the pit we may be confident; that he was in the boxes is unlikely. His
  health was declining in 1739. In his letter to Swift, quoted in Croly's
  edition, vol. i. p. lxxx., he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Having nothing to tell you of my poetry, I come to what is now my
  chief care, my health and amusement; the first is better as to headaches,
  worse as to weakness and nerves. The changes of weather affect me much;
  the mornings are my life, <i>in the evenings I am not dead indeed, but
  sleepy and stupid enough</i>. I love reading still better than
  conversation, but my eyes fail, and the hours when most people indulge in
  company, I am tired, and find the labour of the past day sufficient to
  weigh me down; <i>so I hide myself in bed, as a bird in the nest, much
  about the same time</i>, and rise and chirp in the morning."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I hope I have said enough to stop the farther growth of this story;
  but before laying down my pen, I wish to call attention to the practice
  of giving anecdotes without authorities. This is encouraged by the
  newspapers devoting a column to "varieties," which are often amusing, but
  oftener stale. A paragraph is now commencing the round, telling how a
  lady took a linendraper to a barber's, and on pretence of his being a mad
  relative, had his head shaved, while she absconded with his goods. It is
  a bad version of an excellent scene in Foote's <i>Cozeners</i>.</p>

<h3>INEDITED LETTER OF LORD NELSON.</h3>

  <p>I have in my possession a long letter written by Lord Nelson, sixteen
  days before the battle of Trafalgar, to the Right Hon. Lord Barham, who
  was at that time First Lord of the Admiralty. As an autograph collector,
  I prize it much; and I think that the readers of "N. &amp; Q." might be
  glad to see it. It has not yet, as far as I am aware, been published:</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>My Dear Lord,</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>On Monday the French and Spanish ships took their troops on board
  which had been landed on their arrival, and it is said that they mean to
  sail the first fresh Levant wind. And as the Carthagena ships are ready,
  and, when seen a few days ago, had their topsail yards hoisted up, this
  looks like a junction. The position I have taken for this month, is from
  sixteen to eighteen leagues west of Cadiz; for, although it is most
  desirable that the fleet should be well up in the easterly winds, yet I
  must guard against being caught with a westerly wind near Cadiz: for a
  fleet of ships, with so many three-deckers, would inevitably be forced
  into the Straits, and then Cadiz would be perfectly free for them to come
  out with a westerly wind&mdash;as they served Lord Keith in the late war.
  I am most anxious for the arrival of frigates: less than eight, with the
  brigs, &amp;c., as we settled, I find are absolutely inadequate for this
  service and to be with the fleet; and Spartel, Cape Cantin, or Blanco,
  and the Salvages, must be watched by fast-sailing vessels, in case any
  squadron should escape.</p>

  <p>I have been obliged to send six sail of the line to water and get
  stores, &amp;c. at Tetuan and Gibraltar; for if I did not begin, I should
  very <!-- Page 242 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page242"></a>{242}</span>soon be obliged to take the whole fleet
  into the Straits. I have twenty-three sail with me, and should they come
  out, I shall immediately bring them to battle; but although I should not
  doubt of spoiling any voyage they may attempt, yet I hope for the arrival
  of the ships from England, that, as an enemy's fleet, they may be
  annihilated. Your Lordship may rely upon every exertion from</p>

  <p>I find the Guerrier is reduced to the command of a Lieutenant; I hope
  your Lordship will allow me to seek Sir William Bolton, and to place him
  in the first vacant frigate; he will be acting in a ship when the
  Captains go home with Sir Robert Calder. This will much oblige
  <i>me</i>.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Herefordshire Folk Lore.</i>&mdash;Pray make an imperishable Note
  of the following concentration of Herefordshire folk lore, extracted from
  the "Report of the Secretary of the Diocesan Board of Education," as
  published in <i>The Times</i> of Jan. 28, 1854:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The observation of unlucky days and seasons is by no means unusual.
  The phases of the moon are regarded with great respect: in one medicine
  may be taken; in another it is advisable to kill a pig; over the doors of
  many houses may be found twigs placed crosswise, and never suffered to
  lose their cruciform position; and the horse-shoe preserves its old
  station on many a stable-door. Charms are devoutly believed in. A ring
  made from a shilling offered at the Communion is an undoubted cure for
  fits; hair plucked from the crop of an ass's shoulder, and woven into a
  chain, to be put round a child's neck, is powerful for the same purpose;
  and the hand of a corpse applied to a neck is believed to disperse a wen.
  Not long since, a boy was met running hastily to a neighbour's for some
  holy water, as the only hope of preserving a sick pig. The 'evil eye,' so
  long dreaded in uneducated countries, has its terrors amongst us; and if
  a person of ill life be suddenly called away, there are generally some
  who hear his 'tokens,' or see his ghost. There exists, besides, the
  custom of communicating deaths to hives of bees, in the belief that they
  invariably abandon their owners if the intelligence be withheld."</p>

  <p><i>Greenock Fair.</i>&mdash;A very curious custom existed in this
  town, and in the neighbouring town of Port-Glasgow, within forty years;
  it has now entirely disappeared. I cannot but look upon it as a last
  remnant of the troublous times when arms were in all hands, and property
  liable to be openly and forcibly seized by bands of armed men. This
  custom was, that the whole trades of the town, in the dresses of their
  guilds, with flags and music, each man armed, made a grand rendezvous at
  the place where the fair was to be held, and with drawn swords and array
  of guns and pistols, surrounded the booths, and greeted the baillie's
  announcement by tuck of drum, "that Greenock fair was open," by a
  tremendous shout, and a straggling fire from every serviceable barrel in
  the crowd, and retired, bands playing and flags flying, &amp;c., home.

  <p><i>Dragons' Blood.</i>&mdash;A peculiar custom exists amongst a class,

  procuring dragons' blood; which being carefully wrapped in paper, is
  thrown on the fire, and the following lines said:</p>

  <p>The foregoing charm was told to me a short time since by the agent of
  a large landed proprietor in a fen county. My informant gravely added,
  that he had known numerous instances of this charm being practised, and
  that in every case a cure had been effected. From my own knowledge, I can
  speak of another charm for the ague, in which the fen people put great
  faith, viz. a spider, covered with dough, and taken as a pill.</p>

<h3>Minor Notes.</h3>

  <p>"<i>Garble.</i>"&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr. C. Mansfield
  Ingleby</span> has called attention to a growing corruption in the use of
  the word "eliminate," and I trust he may be able to check its progress.
  The word <i>garble</i> has met with very similar usage, but the corrupt
  meaning is now the only one in which it is ever used, and it would be
  hopeless to try and restore it to its original sense.</p>

  <p>The original sense of "to <i>garble</i>" was a good one, not a bad
  one; it meant a selection of the good, and a discarding of the bad parts
  of anything: its present meaning is exactly the reverse of this. By the
  statute 1 Rich. III. c. 11., it is provided that no bow-staves shall be
  sold "ungarbled:" that is (as Sir E. Coke explains it), until the good
  and sufficient be severed from the bad and insufficient. By statute 1
  Jac. I. c. 19., a penalty is imposed on the sale of spices and drugs not
  "garbled;" and an officer called the <i>garbler</i> of spices is
  authorised to enter shops, and view the spices and drugs, "and to
  <i>garble</i> and make clean the same." Coke derives the word either from
  the French <i>garber</i>, to make fine, neat, clean; or from
  <i>cribler</i>, and that from <i>cribrare</i>, to sift, &amp;c. (4 Inst.
  264.)</p>

  <p>It is easy to see how the corruption of this word has taken place; but
  it is not the less curious to compare the opposite meanings given to it

  <p><i>Deaths in the Society of Friends, 1852-3.</i>&mdash;In "N. &amp;
  Q.," Vol. viii., p. 488., appeared a communication on the great longevity
  of persons at Cleveland in Yorkshire. I send you for comparison a
  statement of the deaths in the Society of Friends in Great Britain and
  Ireland, from the year 1852 to 1853, the accuracy of which may be
  depended on; from which it appears that one in three have attained from
  70 to 100 years, the average being about 74½; and that thirty-seven
  attain from 80 to 90, and eight from 90 to 100. It would be useful to
  ascertain to what the longevity of the inhabitants of Cleveland may be
  attributed, whether to the situation where they reside, or to their
  social habits.</p>

  <p>The total number of the Society was computed to be from 19,000 to
  20,000, showing the deaths to be rather more than 1½ per cent. per annum.
  Great numbers are total abstainers from strong drink.</p>

  <p><i>The Eastern Question.</i>&mdash;The following extract from
  <i>Tatler</i>, No. 155., April 6, 1710, appears remarkable, considering
  the events of the present day:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The chief politician of the Bench was a great assertor of paradoxes.
  He told us, with a seeming concern, 'that by some news he had lately read
  from Muscovy, it appeared to him there was a storm gathering in the Black
  Sea, which might in time do hurt to the naval forces of this nation.' To
  this he added, 'that, for his part, he could not wish to see the Turk
  driven out of Europe, which he believed could not but be prejudicial to
  our woollen manufacture.' He then told us, 'that he looked upon those
  extraordinary revolutions which had lately happened in those parts of the
  world, to have risen chiefly from two persons who were not much talked
  of; and those,' says he, 'are Prince Menzicoff and the Duchess of
  Mirandola.' He backed his assertions with so many broken hints, and such
  a show of depth and wisdom, that we gave ourselves up to his
  opinions."</p>

  <p><i>Jonathan Swift, Dean of St. Patrick's, Dublin.</i>&mdash;It is
  remarkable (and yet it has not been noticed, I believe, by his
  biographers) that Dean Swift was suspended from his degree of B.A. in
  Trinity College, Dublin, for exciting disturbances within the college,
  and insulting the junior dean. He and another were sentenced by the Board
  to ask pardon publicly of the junior dean, on their knees, as having
  offended more atrociously than the rest. These facts afford the true
  solution of Swift's animosity towards the University of Dublin, and
  account for his determination to take the degree of M.A. at Oxford; and
  the solution receives confirmation from this, that the junior dean, for
  insulting whom he was punished, was the same Mr. Owen Lloyd (afterwards
  professor of divinity and Dean of Down) whom Swift has treated with so
  much severity in his account of Lord Wharton.</p>

  <p><i>English Literature.</i>&mdash;Some French writer (Victor Hugo, I
  believe) has said that English literature consists of four distinct
  literatures, English, American, Scottish, and Irish, each having a
  different character. Has this view of our literature been taken, and
  exhibited in all its aspects, by any English writer and if so, by
  whom?</p>

  <p><i>Irish Legislation.</i>&mdash;I have met with the following
  statement: is it to be received as true? In May, 1784, a bill, intended
  to limit the privilege of franking, was sent from Ireland for the royal
  sanction; and in it was a clause enacting that any member who, from
  illness or other cause, should be unable to write, might authorise some
  other person to frank for him, provided that on the back of the letter so
  franked the member gave at the same time, under his hand, a full
  certificate of his inability to write.</p>

  <p><i>Anecdote of George IV. and the Duke of York.</i>&mdash;The
  following letter was written in a boy's round hand, and sent with some
  China cups:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Dear Old Mother Batten,</p>

  <p>Prepare a junket for us, as Fred. and I are coming this evening. I
  send you these cups, which we have stolen from the old woman [the queen].

  <p>The above was found in the bottom of one of the cups, which were sold
  for five guineas on the death of Mr. Nichols, who married Mother Batten.
  The cups are now in possession of a Mr. Toby, No. 10. York Buildings, St.

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>
ANONYMOUS WORKS: "POSTHUMOUS PARODIES,"
"ADVENTURES IN THE MOON," ETC.
</h3>

  <p>A remote correspondent finds all help to fail him from bibliographers
  and cotemporary reviewers in giving any clue to the authorship of the
  works described below. But he has been conversant enough with the "N.
  &amp; Q." to perceive that no Query, that he is aware, has yet been
  started in its pages involving a problem, for which somebody among its
  readers and contributors has not proved a match. Encouraged thereby, he
  tenders the three following titles, in the full faith that his curiosity,
  which is pretty strong, will not have been transmitted over the waste of
  waters but to good result.</p>

  <p>1. <i>Posthumous Parodies, and other Pieces</i>, by several of our
  most celebrated poets, but not before published in any former edition of
  their works: John Miller, London, 12mo., 1814. This contains some twenty
  imitations or over, of the more celebrated minor poems, all of a
  political cast, and breathing strongly the tone of the anti-Jacobin
  verse; executed for the most part, and several of them in particular,
  with great felicity. Among that sort of <i>jeux d'esprit</i> they hardly
  take second place to <i>The Knife Grinder</i>, the mention of which
  reminds me to add that it is manifest enough, from half-a-dozen places in
  the volume, that Canning is the "magnus Apollo" of the satirist. The
  final piece (in which the writer drops his former vein) is written in the
  spirit of sad earnest, in odd contrast with the preceding <i>facetiæ</i>,
  and betokening, in some lines, a disappointed man. Yet, strange to tell,
  through all the range of British criticism of that year, there is an
  utter unconsciousness of its existence. Whether there be another copy on
  this side the Atlantic, besides the one which enables me to <!-- Page 245
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page245"></a>{245}</span>make these few
  comments, your correspondent greatly doubts. One living person there is
  on the other side, it is believed, who could throw light on this
  question, if these lines should be so fortunate as to meet his eye; since
  he is referred to, like many others, by initials and terminals, if not in
  full&mdash;Mr. John Wilson Croker.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Adventures in the Moon and other Worlds</i>: Longman &amp; Co.,
  sm. 8vo., 1836. Of this work, a friend of the writer (who has but
  partially read it as yet himself), of keen discernment, says: "It is a
  work of very marked character. The author is an uncommonly skilful and
  practical writer, a philosophical thinker, and a scholar familiar with
  foreign literature and wide reaches of learning. He has great ingenuity
  and fancy withal; so that he is at the same time exceedingly amusing, and
  suggestive of weighty and subtle thoughts." This, too, is neglected by
  all the reviews.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Lights, Shadows, and Reflections of Whigs and Tories</i>: Lond.
  12mo., 1841. This is a retrospective survey of the several
  administrations of George III. from 1760 (his accession) to the regency
  in 1811; evincing much political insight, with some spirited portraits,
  and indicative both of a close observation of public measures and events,
  and of personal connexion or intercourse with men in high place. There is
  a notice of this in the <i>London Spectator</i> of 1841 (May 29th), and
  in the old <i>Monthly Review</i>; but neither, it is plain, had the
  author's secret.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Harvardiensis.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Cambridge, Massachusetts, N.E.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;Two articles of recent time in the <i>London Quarterly
  Review</i>, the writer would fain trace to their source; "The Life and
  Correspondence of Robert Southey," edited by the Rev. Charles Cuthbert
  Southey, No. 175. (1851), and "Physiognomy," No. 179. (1852), having
  three works as the caption of the article, Sir Charles Bell's celebrated
  work being one.</p>

<h3>BLIND MACKEREL.</h3>

  <p>Can any of your numerous contributors, who may be lovers of
  ichthyology, inform me whether or not the mackerel is blind when it first
  arrives on our coasts? I believe it to be blind, and for the following
  reasons:&mdash;A few years ago, while beating up channel early in June,
  on our homeward-bound voyage from the West Indies, some of the other
  passengers and myself were endeavouring to kill time by fishing for
  mackerel, but without success.</p>

  <p>When the pilot came on board and saw what we were about, he laughed at
  us, and said, "Oh, gentlemen, you will not take them with the hook,
  because the fish is blind." We laughed in our turn, thinking he took us
  for flat-fish, and wished to amuse himself at our expense. Observing this
  he said, "I will convince you that it is so," and brought from his boat
  several mackerel he had taken by net. He then pointed out a film over the
  eye, which he said prevented the fish seeing when it first made our
  coast, and explained that this film gradually disappeared, and that
  towards the middle of June the eye was perfectly clear, and that the fish
  could then take the bait.</p>

  <p>I have watched this fish for some years past, and have invariably
  observed this film quite over the eye in the early part of the mackerel
  season, and that it gradually disappears until the eye is left quite
  clear. This film appears like an ill-cleared piece of calf's-foot jelly
  spread over the eye, but does not strike you as a natural part of the
  fish, but rather as something extraneous. I have also remarked that when
  the fish is boiled, that this patch separates, and then resembles a piece
  of discoloured white of egg. This film may be observed by any one who
  takes the trouble of looking at the eye of the mackerel.</p>

  <p>I have looked into every book on natural history I could get hold of,
  and in none is the slightest notice taken of this; therefore I suppose my
  conclusion as to its blindness is wrong; but I do not consider this to be
  conclusive, as all we can learn from books is, "<i>Scomber</i> is the
  mackerel genus, and is too well known to require description." I believe
  less is known about fish than any other animals; and should you think
  this question on natural history worthy a place in your "N. &amp; Q.," I
  will feel obliged by your giving it insertion.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Original Words of old Scotch Airs.</i>&mdash;Can any one tell me
  where the original words of many fine old Scotch airs are to be found?
  The wretched verses of Allan Ramsay, and others of the same school, are
  adapted to the "Yellow-haired Laddie," "Ettrick Banks," "The Bush aboon
  Traquair," "Mary Scott," and hundreds of others. There must exist old
  words to many of these airs, which at least will possess some local
  characteristics, and be a blessed change from the "nymphs" and "swains,"
  the "Stephens" and "Lythias," which now pollute and degrade them. Any
  information on this subject will be received most thankfully. I
  particularly wish to recover some old words to the air of "Mary Scott."
  The only verse I remember is this,&mdash;</p>

  Castle guns are never fired in salute, in consequence, it is said, of the

  twenty-one was the number fixed for a royal salute?</p>

  Polygamy permitted among the early Christians? Paul's direction to
  Timothy, that a bishop should be "the husband of one wife," seems to show
  that it was; though I am aware that the phrase has been interpreted
  otherwise. 5. On what ground has polygamy become forbidden among
  Christians? I am not aware that it is directly forbidden by
  Scripture.</p>

  <p><i>Description of Battles.</i>&mdash;Judging from my own experience,
  historical details of battles are comparatively unintelligible to
  non-military readers. Now that, unhappily, we shall probably be compelled
  to "hear of battles," would not some of our enterprising publishers do
  well to furnish to the readers of history and of the bulletins, a popular
  "Guide to the Battle Field," drawn up some talented military officer? It
  must contain demonstratively clear diagrams, and such explanations of all
  that needs to be known, as an officer would give, on the spot, to his
  nonprofessional friend. The effects of eminences, rivers, roads, woods,
  marshes, &amp;c., should be made plain; in short, nothing should be
  omitted which is necessary to render an account of a battle intelligible
  to ordinary readers, instead of being, as is too often the case, a mere
  chaotic assemblage of words.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Thinks I to Myself.</span></p>

  <p><i>Do Martyrs always feel Pain?</i>&mdash;Is it not possible that an
  exalted state of feeling&mdash;approaching perhaps to the mesmeric
  state&mdash;may be attained, which will render the religious or political
  martyr insensible to pain? It would be agreeable to think that the pangs
  of martyrdom were ever thus alleviated. It is certainly possible, by a
  strong mental effort, to keep pain in subjection during a dental
  operation. A firmly fixed tooth, under a bungling operator, may be
  wrenched from the jaw without pain to the patient, if he will only
  determine not to feel. At least, I know of one such case, and that the
  effort was very exhausting. In the excitement of battle, wounds are often
  not felt. One would be glad to hope that Joan of Arc was insensible to
  the flames which consumed her: and that the recovered nerve which enabled
  Cranmer to submit his right hand to the fire, raised him above
  suffering.</p>

  <p><i>Carronade.</i>&mdash;What is the derivation of the term
  <i>carronade</i>, applied to pieces of ordnance shorter and thicker in
  the chamber than usual? Here the idea is that they took their name from
  the Carron foundries, where they were cast. In the early years of the old
  war-time, there were carron pieces or carron guns, and only some
  considerable time thereafter carronades. How does this stand? and is
  there any likelihood of the folk story being true?</p>

  <p><i>Darcy, of Platten, co. Meath.</i>&mdash;It is on record that, in
  the year 1486, the citizens of Dublin, encouraged by the Earl of Kildare
  and the Archbishop, received Lambert Simnel, and actually crowned him
  King of England and Ireland in Christ's Church; and that to make the
  solemnity more imposing, they not only borrowed a crown for the occasion
  from the head of the image of the Virgin that stood in the church
  dedicated to her service at Dame's Gate, but carried the young impostor
  on the shoulders of "a monstrous man, one Darcy, of Platten, in the
  county of Meath."</p>

  <p>Did this "monstrous man" leave any descendants? And if so, is there
  any representative, and where, at the present day? Platten has long since
  passed into other hands.</p>

  <p><i>King's Prerogative.</i>&mdash;A writer in the <i>Edinburgh
  Review</i>, vol. lxxiv. p. 77., asserts, on the authority of Blackstone
  (but he does not refer to the volume and page of the <i>Commentaries</i>,
  and I have in vain sought for the passages), that it is to <i>this
  day</i> a branch of the king's prerogative, at the death of <i>every
  bishop</i>, to have his kennel of hounds, or a compensation in lieu of
  it. Does the writer mean, and is it the fact, that if a bishop die
  without having a kennel of hounds, his executors are to pay the king a
  compensation in lieu thereof? And if it is, what is the amount of that
  compensation? Is it merely nominal? I can understand the king claiming a
  bishop's kennel of hounds or compensation in feudal times, when bishops
  were hunters (vide Raine's <i>Auckland Castle</i>, a work of great merit,
  and abounding with much curious information); but to say, to <i>this
  day</i> it is a branch of the king's prerogative, is an insult alike to
  our bishops and to religious practices in the nineteenth century. Of
  hunting bishops in feudal times, I beg to refer your readers, in addition
  to Mr. Raine's work, to an article in the fifty-eighth volume of the
  <i>Quarterly Review</i>, p. 433., for an extract from a letter of Peter
  of Blois to Walter, Bishop of Rochester, who at the age of eighty was a
  great hunter. Peter was shocked at his lordship's indulgence in so
  unclerical a sport. It is obvious neither Peter nor the Pope could have
  heard of the hunting Bishops of Durham.</p>

  regicide (the Rev. John Cawley) became a rector of the neighbouring

<h3>Minor Queries with Answers.</h3>

  <p><i>Dr. John Pocklington.</i>&mdash;Can any of your correspondents

  <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1640; and he died Nov. 14, 1642. Dr.
  Pocklington descended from Ralph Pocklington, who, with his brother
  Roger, followed Margaret of Anjou after the battle of Wakefield, <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1460. He is said to have settled in the west,
  where he lived to have three sons. The family is mentioned in connexion
  with the county of York, as early as <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  1253.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[John Pocklington was first a scholar at Sidney Sussex College, B.D.
  in 1621, and afterwards a Fellow of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge. He
  subsequently became Rector of Yelden in Bedfordshire, Vicar of Waresley
  in Huntingdonshire, prebend of Lincoln, Peterborough, and Windsor; and
  was also one of the chaplains to Charles I. "On the 15th May, 1611, the
  Earl of Kent, with consent of Lord Harington, wrote to Sidney College to
  dispense with Mr. Pocklington's holding a small living with cure of
  souls. <!-- Page 248 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  Pamphlets in the British Museum is "The Petition and Articles exhibited
  in Parliament against John Pocklington, D.D., Parson of Yelden, in
  Bedfordshire, anno 1641." The petition "humbly sheweth, That John
  Pocklington, D.D., Rector of the parish of Yelden in the county of
  Bedford, Vicar of Waresley in the county of Huntingdon, Prebend of
  Lincoln, Peterborough, and Windsor, hath been a chief author and
  ringleader in all those innovations which have of late flowed into the

  singularly illustrative of the ecclesiastical usages in the reign of
  Charles I., and would make a curious appendix to the <span
  class="sc">Rev. H.&nbsp;T. Ellacombe's</span> article at p. 257. of the
  present Number. Having rendered himself obnoxious to the popular faction
  by the publication of his <i>Altare Christianum</i> and <i>Sunday no
  Sabbath</i>, the parliament that met on Nov. 3, 1640, ordered these two
  works to be burnt by the common hangman in both the Universities, and in
  the city of London. He died on November 14, and was buried Nov. 16, 1642,
  in the churchyard of Peterborough Cathedral. On his monumental slab is
  the following inscription: "John Pocklington, S.S. Theologia Doctor,
  obiit Nov. 14, 1642." A copy of his will is in the British Museum
  (Lansdown, 990, p. 74.). It is dated Sept. 6, 1642; and in it bequests
  are made to his daughters Margaret and Elizabeth, and his sons John and
  Oliver. His wife Anne was made sole executrix. He orders his body "to be
  buried in Monk's churchyard, at the foot of those monks martyrs whose
  monument is well known: let there be a fair stone with a great crosse cut
  upon it laid on my grave." For notices of Dr. Pocklington, see Willis's

  <p><i>Last Marquis of Annandale.</i>&mdash;1. When and where did he die?
  2. Any particulars regarding his history? 3. When and why was Lochwood,
  the family residence, abandoned? 4. How many marquisses were there, and
  were any of them men of any note in their day and generation?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Annandale.</span></p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The first marquis was William Johnstone, third Earl of Annandale and
  Hartfell, who was advanced 4th June, 1701, to the Marquisate of
  Annandale. He died at Bath, 14th January, 1721, and was succeeded by his
  son James, who died 21st February, 1730. George, his half-brother, born
  29th May, 1720, was the third and last Marquis of Annandale. An inquest
  from the Court of Chancery, 5th March, 1748, found this marquis a
  lunatic, and incapable of governing himself and his estate, and that he
  had been so from the 12th December, 1744. He died at Turnham Green on the
  29th April, 1792, in the seventy-second year of his age, and was buried
  at Chiswick, 7th May following. (<i>Gent. Mag.</i>, May, 1792, p. 481.)
  Since his decease the honours of the house of Annandale have remained
  dormant, although they have been claimed by several branches of the
  family. (Burke's <i>Extinct Peerages</i>.) Before the union of the two
  crowns the Johnstones were frequently wardens of the west borders, and
  were held in enthusiastic admiration for their exploits against the
  English, the Douglasses, and other borderers. During the wars between the
  two nations, they effectually suppressed the plunderers on the borders;
  hence their device, a winged spur, and their motto, "Alight thieves all,"
  to denote their authority in commanding them to surrender. Lochwood, the
  ancient seat of the Marquisses of Annandale, was inhabited till 1724,
  three years after the death of the first marquis, when it was finally
  abandoned by the family, and suffered gradually to fall into decay. In
  <i>The New Statistical Account of Scotland</i>, vol. iv. p. 112., we read
  "that the principal estate in the parish of Moffat has descended to Mr.
  Hope Johnstone of Annandale, to whom it is believed the titles also, in
  so far as claimed, of right belong, and whose restoration to the dormant
  honours of the family would afford universal satisfaction in this part of
  Scotland; because it is the general feeling that he has a right to them,
  and that in his family they would not only be supported, but graced."
  Some farther particulars of the three marquisses will be found in
  Douglass' <i>Peerage of Scotland</i> (by Wood), vol. i. p. 75., and in
  <i>The Scots Compendium</i>, edit. 1764, p. 151.]</p>

  Richard's reign, it is not practicable. Some idea may be formed of the
  heraldic body at the commencement of this reign, by observing the names
  of those who attended the funeral of Edward IV. Sandford and other
  writers mention Garter, Clarenceux, Norroy, March, and Ireland,

<h3>DOGS IN MONUMENTAL BRASSES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 126.)</p>

  <p>I may refer <span class="sc">Mr. B. H. Alford</span> to the Oxford
  <i>Manual of Monumental Brasses</i>, p. 56., for an answer to his
  Query:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Knights have no peculiar devices besides their arms, unless we are to
  consider the lions and dogs beneath their feet as emblematical of the
  virtues of courage, generosity, and fidelity, indispensable to their
  profession. One or two dogs are often at the feet of the lady. They are
  probably intended for some favourite animal, as the name is occasionally
  inscribed," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Neither dog nor lion occurs at the feet of the following knights
  represented on brasses prior to 1460:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"c. 1450. Sir John Peryent, Jun., Digswell, Herts. (engd.
  Boutell.)</p>

  <p>1455. John Daundelyon, Esq., Margate. (ditto.)</p>

  <p>c. 1360. William de Aldeburgh, Aldborough, Yorkshire. (engd.

  <p>c. 1380. Sir Edward Cerue, Draycot Cerue, Wiltshire. (engd.

  <p>1413. c. 1420. John Cressy, Esq., Dodford, Northants. (ditto.)</p>

  <p>1445. Thomas de St. Quintin, Esq., Harpham, Yorkshire. (ditto.)"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Whilst a dog is seen in the following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"1462. Sir Thomas Grene, Green's Norton, Northants. (ditto.)</p>

  <p>1510. John Leventhorpe, Esq., St. Helen's, Bishopsgate.

  <p>1471. Wife of Thomas Colte, Esq., Roydon, Essex.</p>

  <p>c. 1480. Brass at Grendon, Northants.</p>

  <p>c. 1485. Brass, Latton, Essex.</p>

  <p>1501. Robert Baynard, Esq., Laycock, Wilts."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>These examples are described or engraved in the works of the Rev. C.
  Boutell, or in the Oxford <i>Manual</i>, and I have little doubt that my
  own collection of rubbings (if I had leisure to examine it) would supply
  other examples under both of these sections.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">W. Sparrow Simpson.</span></p>

  <p>It is usually asserted that the dog appears at the feet of the lady in
  monumental brasses as a symbol of fidelity; while the lion accompanies
  her lord as the emblem of strength and courage. These distinctions,
  however, do not appear to have been much attended to. The dog, in most
  cases a greyhound, very frequently appears at the feet of a knight or
  civilian, as on the brasses of the Earl of Warwick, 1401, Sir John
  Falstolf at Oulton, 1445, Sir John Leventhorpe at Sawbridgeworth, 1433,
  Sir Reginald de Cobham at Lingfield, 1403, Richard Purdaunce, Mayor of
  Norwich, 1436, and Peter Halle, Esquire, at Herne, Kent, 1420. Sir John
  Botiler, at St. Bride's, Glamorganshire, 1285, has a dragon; and on the
  brass of Alan Fleming, at Newark, 1361, appears a lion with a human face
  seizing a smaller lion. On a very late brass of Sir Edward Warner, at
  Little Plumstead, Norfolk, 1565, appears a greyhound, a full century
  after the date assigned by <span class="sc">B.&nbsp;H. Alford</span> for the
  cessation of these symbolical figures.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the lady has two little dogs, as Lady Bagot, at Baginton,
  Warwickshire, 1407; and in one instance, that of Lady Peryent, at
  Digswell, Herts, 1415, there is a hedgehog, the meaning of which is
  sufficiently obvious. <span class="sc">B.&nbsp;H. Alford</span>, in noticing
  the omission of the dog in the brass of Lady Camoys at Trotton, 1424, has
  not mentioned a singular substitute which is found for it, namely, the
  figure of a boy or young man, standing by the lady's right foot: but what
  this means I cannot attempt to determine; perhaps her only son.</p>

  <p>It may be interesting to add that some brasses of ecclesiastics
  exhibit strange figures, not easy to interpret, if meant as symbolical.
  The brass at <!-- Page 250 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page250"></a>{250}</span>Oulton, of the priest &mdash;&mdash; de
  Bacon, 1310, has a lion; that of the Abbot Delamere, at St. Albans, 1375,
  two dragons; that of a priest at North Mimms, about 1360, a stag; and,
  still more extraordinary, that of Laurence Seymour, a priest, at Higham
  Ferrers, 1337, two dogs contending for a bone.</p>

<h3>SNEEZING.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 366. 624.; Vol. ix., p. 63.)</p>

  <p>I can add another item of the folk lore to those already quoted. One
  of the salutations, by which a sneezer is greeted amongst the lower class
  of Romans at the present day, is <i>Figli maschi</i>, "May you have male
  children!"</p>

  <p>The best essay on <i>sneezing</i>, that I am acquainted with, is to be
  found in Strada's <i>Prolusions</i>, book iii. Prol. 4., in which he
  replies at some length, and not unamusingly, to the Query, "Why are
  sneezers saluted?" It seems to have arisen out of an occurrence which had
  recently taken place at Rome, that a certain <i>Pistor Suburranus</i>,
  after having sneezed twenty-three times consecutively, had expired at the
  twenty-fourth sneeze: and his object is to prove that Sigonius was
  mistaken in supposing that the custom of saluting a sneezer had only
  dated from the days of Gregory the Great, when many had died of the
  plague in the act of sneezing. In opposition to this notion, he adduces
  passages from Apuleius and Petronius Arbiter, besides those from
  Ammianus, Athenæus, Aristotle, and Homer, already quoted in your pages by
  <span class="sc">Mr. F.&nbsp;J. Scott</span>. He then proceeds to give five
  causes from which the custom may have sprung, and classifies them as
  religious, medical, facetious, poetical, and augural.</p>

  <p>Under the first head, he argues that the salutation given to sneezers
  is not a mere expression of good wishes, but a kind of veneration: "for,"
  says he, "we rise to a person sneezing, and humbly uncover our heads, and
  deal reverently with him." In proof of this position, he tells us that in
  Ethiopia, when the emperor sneezed, the salutations of his adoring
  gentlemen of the privy chamber were so loudly uttered as to be heard and
  re-echoed by the whole of his court; and thence repeated in the streets,
  so that the whole city was in simultaneous commotion.</p>

  <p>The other heads are then pursued with considerable learning, and some
  humour; and, under the last, he refers us to St. Augustin, <i>De Doctr.
  Christ.</i> ii. 20., as recording that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"When the ancients were getting up in the morning, if they chanced to
  sneeze whilst putting on their shoes, they immediately went back to bed
  again, in order that they might get up more auspiciously, and escape the
  misfortunes which were likely to occur on that day."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>One almost wishes that people now-a-days would sometimes consent to
  follow their example, when they have "got out of bed the wrong way."</p>

<h3>SIR JOHN DE MORANT.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 56.)</p>

  <p>In answer to the Query of H. H. M., I beg to state that the Sir John
  de Morant chronicled by Froissart was Jean de Morant, Chevalier, Seigneur
  d'Escours, and other lordships in Normandy. He was fourth in descent from
  Etienne de Morant, Chevalier, living <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1245,
  and son of Etienne de Morant and his wife Marie de Pottier. His posterity
  branched off into many noble Houses; as the Marquis de Morant, and
  Mesnil-Garnier, the Count de Panzès, the Barons of Fontenay, Rupierre,
  Biéville, Coulonces, the Seigneurs de Courseulles, Brequigny, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The Sire Jean de Morant, born <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1346, was
  the hero of the following adventure, quoted from an ancient chronicle of
  Brittany, by Chesnaye-Desbois. It appears that the Sire de Morant was one
  of five French knights, who fought a combat <i>à l'outrance</i> against
  an equal number of English challengers, with the sanction, and in the
  presence, of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, A.D. 1381-2. The result
  was in favour of the French. The chronicle proceeds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Le Sire de Morant s'étant principalement distingué dans cette action,
  un Chevalier Anglois lui propose de venger, tête-à-tête, la défaite de
  ses compatriotes, et qu'ils en vinrent aux mains; mais que l'Anglois,
  qu'une indisposition aux genouils avoit forcé de combattre sans bottes
  garnies, avoit engagé son adversaire de quitter les siennes, en
  promettant, parole d'honneur, de ne point abuser de cette condescendance,
  à quoi le Sire de Morant consentit: le perfide Anglois ne lui tint pas
  parole, et lui porta trois coups d'épée dans la jambe. Le Duc de
  Lancastre, qui en fut témoin, fit arrêter ce lâche, et le fit mettre
  entre les mains du Sire de Morant, pour tirer telle vengeance qu'il
  jugeroit à propos, ou du moins le contraindre à lui payer une forte
  rançon. Le Seigneur de Morant remercia ce Prince, en lui disant 'qu'il
  étoit venu de Bretagne non pour de l'or, mais pour l'honneur' et le
  supplia de recevoir en grace l'Anglois, attribuant à son peu d'adresse ce
  qui n'étoit que l'effet de sa trahison. Le Duc de Lancastre, charmé d'une
  si belle réponse, lui envoya une coupe d'or et une somme considérable.
  Morant refusa la somme, et se contenta de la coupe d'or, par respect pour
  le Prince."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There is a short account of the branch of Morant de Mesnil-Garnier in
  the <i>Généalogie de France</i>, by Le Père Anselme, vol. ix.; but a very
  full and complete pedigree is contained in the eighth volume of the
  <i>Dict. de la Noblesse Française</i>, by M. de la Chesnaye-Desbois. <!--
  Page 251 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251"></a>{251}</span></p>

  <p>As the Rev. Philip Morant was a native of Jersey, it is more than
  probable that he was an offset of the ancient Norman stock, though their
  armorial bearings are widely different. The latter bore, Azure, three
  cormorants argent; but the family of Astle, of Colne Park in Essex, are
  said to quarter for Morant, Gules, on a chevron argent, three talbots
  passant sable.</p>

  <p>Having only a daughter and heiress, married to Thomas Astle, Keeper of
  the Records in the Tower of London, the reverend historian of Essex could
  hardly have been the ancestor of the Morants of Brockenhurst.</p>

  <p>There was also another family in Normandy, named Morant de
  Bois-ricard, in no way connected with the first, who bore Gules, a bend
  ermine.</p>

<h3>INN SIGNS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 148.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Alphege</span> will find a good paper on the origin
  of signs in the <i>Mirror</i>, vol. ii. p. 387.; also an article on the
  present specimens of country ale-house signs, in the first volume of the
  same interesting periodical, p. 101. In Hone's <i>Every-Day Book</i>,
  vol. i., are notices of curious signs at pp. 1262. and 1385. In vol. ii.
  some very amusing specimens are given at p. 789. Others occur in Hone's
  <i>Table-Book</i>, at pp. 448. 504. and 756.</p>

  <p class="author">F. C. H.</p>

  <p>I can answer <span class="sc">Alphege</span>'s Query, having some
  notes by me on the subject. He will pardon my throwing them, in a
  shapeless heap, jolting out as you unload stones.</p>

  <p>The Romans had signs; and at Pompeii a pig over the door represents a
  wine-shop within. The Middle Ages adopted a bush. "Good wine needs no
  bush," &amp;c., answering to the gilded grapes at a modern vintner's. The
  bush is still a common sign. At Charles I.'s death, a cavalier landlord
  painted his bush black. Then came the modern square sign, formerly common
  to all trades. Old signs are generally heraldic, and represent royal
  bearings, or the blazonings of great families. The White Hart was
  peculiar to Richard II; the White Swan of Henry IV. and Edward III.; the
  Blue Boar of Richard III.; the Red Dragon came in with the Tudors. Then
  we have the Bear and Ragged Staff of Leicester, &amp;c. Monograms are
  common; as Bolt and Tun for <i>Bolton</i>; Hare and Tun for
  <i>Harrington</i>. The Three Suns is the favourite bearing of Edward IV.;
  and all Roses, white or red (as at Tewkesbury), are indications of
  political predilection. Other signs commemorate historical events; as the
  Bull and Mouth, Bull and Gate (the Boulogne engagement in Henry VIII.'s
  time, and alluded to by Shakspeare). The Pilgrim, Cross Keys, Salutation,
  Catherine Wheel, Angel, Three Kings, Seven Stars, St. Francis, &amp;c.,
  are medieval signs. Many are curiously corrupted; as the C&oelig;ur Doré
  (Golden Heart) to the Queer Door; Bacchanals (the Bag of Nails); Pig and
  Whistle (Peg and Wassail Bowl); the Swan and Two Necks (literally Two
  <i>Nicks</i>); Goat and Compasses (God encompasseth us); The Bell Savage
  (La Belle Sauvage, or Isabel Savage); the Goat in the Golden Boots (from
  the Dutch, Goed in der Gooden Boote), Mercury, or the God in the Golden
  Boots. The Puritans altered many of the monastic signs; as the Angel and
  Lady, to the Soldier and Citizen. In signs we may read every phase of
  ministerial popularity, and all the ebbs and flows of war in the Sir Home
  Popham, Rodney, Shovel, Duke of York, Wellington's Head, &amp;c. At
  Chelsea, a sign called the "Snow Shoes," I believe, still indicates the
  excitement of the American war.</p>

  <p>I shall be happy to send <span class="sc">Alphege</span> more
  instances, or to answer any conjectures.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">G. W. Thornbury.</span></p>

  <p>A century ago, when the houses in streets were unnumbered, they were
  distinguished by sign-boards. The chemist had the dragon (some
  astrological device); the pawnbroker the three golden pills, the arms of
  the Medici and Lombardy, as the descendant of the ancient bankers of
  England; the barber-chirurgeon the pole for the wig, and the
  parti-coloured ribands to bind up the patient's wounds after
  blood-letting; the haberdasher and wool-draper the golden fleece; the
  tobacconist the snuff-taking Highlander; the vintner the bunch of grapes
  and ivy-bush; and the Church and State bookseller the Bible and crown.
  The Crusaders brought in the signs of the Saracen's Head, the Turk's
  Head, and the Golden Cross. Near the church were found the Lamb and Flag,
  The Bell, the Cock of St. Peter, the Maiden's Head, and the Salutation of
  St. Mary. The Chequers commemorated the licence granted by the Earls of
  Arundel, or Lords Warrenne. The Blue Boar was the cognizance of the House
  of Oxford (and so The Talbots, The Bears, White Lions, &amp;c. may
  usually be reasonably referred to the supporters of the arms of noble
  families, whose tenants the tavern landlords were). The Bull and Mouth,
  the hostelry of the voyager to Boulogne Harbour. The Castle, The Spread
  Eagle, and The Globe (Alphonso's), were probably adopted from the arms of
  Spain, Germany, and Portugal, by inns which were the resort of merchants
  from those countries. The Belle Sauvage recalled some show of the day;
  the St. George and Dragon commemorated the badge of the Garter, the Rose
  and Fleur-de-Lys, the Tudors; The Bull, The Falcon, <!-- Page 252
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252"></a>{252}</span>and Plume of
  Feathers, Edward IV.; the Swan and Antelope were the arms of Henry V.;
  the chained or White Hart of Richard II.; the Sun and Boar of King
  Richard III.; the Greyhound and Green Dragon of Henry VII. The Bag o'
  Nails disguised the former Bacchanals; the Cat and Fiddle the Caton
  Fidele; the Goat and Compasses was the rebus of the Puritan motto "God
  encompasseth us." The Swan with Two Nicks represented the Thames swans,
  so marked on their bills under the "conservatory" of the Goldsmiths'
  Company. The Cocoa Tree and Thatched House tell their own tale; so the
  Coach and Horses, reminding us of the times when the superior inns were
  the only posting-houses, in distinction to such as bore the sign of the
  Pack-Horse. The Fox and Goose denoted the games played within; the
  country inn, the Hare and Hounds, the vicinity of a sporting squire.</p>

<h3>"CONSILIUM DELECTORUM CARDINALIUM."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 54. Vol. ix., pp. 127-29.)</p>

  <p>Novus did not require correction; but <span class="sc">Mr. B. B.
  Woodward</span> has elaborately confounded the genuine <i>Consilium</i>
  of 1537 with Vergerio's spurious Letter of Advice, written in 1549.
  <i>Four</i> cardinals, and not <i>nine</i> (as <span class="sc">Mr.
  Woodward</span> supposes), subscribed the authentic document; but perhaps
  <i>novem</i> may have been a corruption of <i>novum</i>, applied to the
  later Bolognese <i>Consilium</i>; or else the word was intended to denote
  the number of <i>all</i> the dignitaries who addressed Pope Paul III.</p>

  <p class="author">R. G.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This Consilium was the result of an assembly of four cardinals, among
  whom was our Pole, and five prelates, by Paul III. in 1537, charged to
  give him their best advice relative to a reformation of the church. The
  corruptions of that community were detailed and denounced with more
  freedom than might have been expected, or was probably desired; so much
  so, that when one of the body, Cardinal Caraffa, assumed the tiara as
  Paul IV., he transferred his own <i>advice</i> into his own list of
  prohibited books. The Consilium became the subject of an animated
  controversy. M&lsquo;Crie in his <i>History of the Reformation in
  Italy</i>, has given a satisfactory account of the whole, pp. 83, &amp;c.
  The candid Quirini could maintain neither the spuriousness of this
  important document, nor its non-identity with the one condemned in the
  Index. (See Schelborn's Two Epistles on the subject, Tiguri, 1748.) And
  now observe, gentle reader, the pontifical artifice which this discussion
  has produced. Not in the Index following the year 1748, namely, that of
  1750 (that was too soon), but in the next, that of 1758, the article
  appears thus: 'Consilium de emendanda Ecclesia. <i>Cum Notis vel
  Præfationibus Hæreticorum. Ind. Trid.</i>' The whole, particularly the
  Ind. Trid., is an implied and real falsehood."&mdash; Mendham's
  <i>Literary Policy of the Church of Rome</i>, pp. 48, 49.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>M. Barbier, in his <i>Dictionnaire des Pseudoynmes</i>, has given his
  opinion of the genuineness of the Consilium in the following note, in
  reply to some queries on the subject:</p>

  <p>"Monsieur.&mdash;Le <i>Consilium quorundam Episcoporum</i>, &amp;c.,
  me paraît une pièce bien authentique, puisque Brown déclare l'avoir
  trouvé non-seulement dans les &oelig;uvres de Vergerio, mais encore dans

<h3>PULPIT HOUR-GLASSES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 82. 209. 279. 328. 454. 525.)</p>

  <p>I should be glad to see some more information in your pages relative
  to the <i>early</i> use of the pulpit hour-glass. It is said that the
  ancient fathers preached, as the old Greek and Roman orators declaimed,
  by this instrument; but were the sermons of the ancient fathers an hour
  long? Many of those in St. Augustine's ten volumes might be delivered
  with distinctness in seven or eight minutes; and some of those of Latimer
  and his contemporaries, in about the same time. But, Query, are not the
  <i>printed</i> sermons of these divines merely outlines, to be filled up
  by the preacher <i>extempore</i>? Dyos, in a sermon preached at Paul's
  Cross, in 1570, speaking of the walking and profane talking in the church
  at sermon time, also laments how they grudged the preacher his
  <i>customary hour</i>. So that an hour seems to have been the practice at
  the Reformation. <!-- Page 253 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page253"></a>{253}</span></p>

  <p>The hour-glass was used equally by the Catholics and Protestants. In
  an account of the fall of the house in Blackfriars, where a party of
  Romanists were assembled to hear one of their preachers, in 1623, the
  preacher is described as&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Having on a surplice, girt about his middle with a linnen girdle, and
  a tippet of scarlet on both his shoulders. He was attended by a man that
  brought after him his book and <i>hour-glass</i>."&mdash;See <i>The Fatal
  Vespers</i>, by Samuel Clark, London, 1657.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the Preface to the Bishops' <i>Bible</i>, printed by John Day in
  1569, Archbishop Parker is represented with an <i>hour-glass</i> at his
  right hand. And in a work by Franchinus Gaffurius, entitled <i>Angelicum
  ac Divinum opus Musice</i>, printed at Milan in 1508, is a curious
  representation of the author seated in a pulpit, with a book in his hand;
  an <i>hour-glass</i> on one side, and a bottle on the other; lecturing to
  an audience of twelve persons. This woodcut is engraved in the second
  volume of Hawkins' <i>History of Music</i>, p. 333.</p>

  <p>Hour-glasses were often very elegantly formed, and of rich materials.
  Shaw, in his <i>Dresses and Decorations of the Middle Ages</i>, has given
  an engraving of one in the cabinet of M. Debruge at Paris. It is richly
  enamelled, and set with jewels. In the churchwardens' accounts of Lambeth
  Church are two entries respecting the hour-glass: the first is in 1579,
  when 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> was "payd to Yorke for the frame in which the
  <i>hower</i> standeth;" and the second in 1615, when 6<i>s.</i>
  8<i>d.</i> was "payd for an iron for the <i>hour-glasse</i>." In an
  inventory of the goods and implements belonging to the church of All
  Saints, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, taken about 1632, mention is made of "one
  <i>whole</i> hour-glasse," and of "one <i>halfe</i> hour-glasse." (See
  Brand's <i>Newcastle</i>, vol. i. p. 370.).</p>

  <p>Fosbroke says, "Preaching by the <i>hour-glass</i> was put an end to
  by the Puritans" (<i>Ency. of Antiq.</i>, vol. i. pp. 273. 307.). But the
  account given by a correspondent of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>
  (1804, p. 201.) is probably more correct:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Hour-glasses, in the puritanical days of Cromwell, were made use of
  by the preachers; who, on first getting into the pulpit, and naming the
  text, turned up the glass; and if the sermon did not hold till the glass
  was out, it was said by the congregation that the preacher was lazy: and
  if he continued to preach much longer, they would yawn and stretch, and
  by these signs signify to the preacher that they began to be weary of his
  discourse, and wanted to be dismissed."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Butler speaks of "gifted brethren preaching by a carnal
  <i>hour-glass</i>" (<i>Hudibras</i>, Part I., canto III., v. 1061.). And
  in the frontispiece of Dr. Young's book, entitled <i>England's Shame, or
  a Relation of the Life and Death of Hugh Peters</i>, London, 1663, Peters
  is represented preaching, and holding an <i>hour-glass</i> in his left
  hand, in the act of saying: "I know you are good fellows, so let's have
  another <i>glass</i>." The same words, or something very similar, are
  attributed to the Nonconformist minister, Daniel Burgess. Mr. Maidment,
  in a note to "The New Litany," printed in his <i>Third Book of Scottish
  Pasquils</i> (Edin., 1828, p. 49.), also gives the following version of
  the same:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A humorous story has been preserved of one of the Earls of Airly, who
  entertained at his table a clergyman, who was to preach before the
  Commissioner next day. The glass circulated, perhaps too freely; and
  whenever the divine attempted to rise, his Lordship prevented him,
  saying, 'Another glass, and then.' After 'flooring' (if the expression
  may be allowed) his Lordship, the guest went home. He next day selected a
  text: 'The wicked shall be punished, and that <span class="scac">RIGHT
  EARLY</span>.' Inspired by the subject, he was by no means sparing of his
  oratory, and the hour-glass was disregarded, although repeatedly warned
  by the precentor; who, in common with Lord Airly, thought the discourse
  rather lengthy. The latter soon knew why he was thus punished by the
  reverend gentleman, when reminded, always exclaiming, <i>not</i> sotto
  voce, 'Another glass, and then.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Hogarth, in his "Sleeping Congregation," has introduced an hour-glass
  on the left side of the preacher; and Mr. Ireland observes, in his
  description of this plate, that they are "still placed on some of the
  pulpits in the provinces." At Waltham, in Leicestershire, by the side of
  the pulpit was (or is) an hour-glass in an iron frame, mounted on three
  high wooden brackets. (See Nichols' <i>Leicestershire</i>, vol. ii p.
  382.) A bracket for the support of an hour-glass is still preserved,
  affixed to the pulpit of Hurst Church, in Berkshire: it is of iron,
  painted and gilt. An interesting notice, accompanied by woodcuts, of a
  number of existing specimens of hour-glass frames, was contributed to the
  <i>Journal of the British Archæological Association</i>, vol. iii., 1848,
  by Mr. Fairholt, to which I refer the reader for farther information.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Edward F. Rimbault.</span></p>

  <p>I remember to have seen it stated in some antiquarian journal, that
  there are only three hour-glass stands in England where any portion of
  the glass is remaining. In Cowden Church, in Kent, the glass is nearly
  entire. Perhaps some of your readers will be able to mention the two
  other places.</p>

  <p class="author">W. D. H.</p>

  <p>In Salhouse Church, near Norwich, an iron hour-glass stand still
  remains fixed to the pulpit; and a bell on the screen, between the nave
  and the chancel.</p>

  <p class="author">C&mdash;s. T. P.</p>

  <p>At Berne, in the autumn of last year, I saw an hour-glass stand
  <i>still</i> attached to the pulpit in the minster.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>A Prize for the best Collodion.</i>&mdash;Your "Hint to the
  Photographic Society" (Feb. 25) I much approve of, but I have always
  found more promptness from individuals than from associated bodies; and
  all photographers I deem to be under great obligations to <i>you</i> in
  affording us a medium of communication before a Photographic Society was
  in existence. During the past month your valuable articles, from some of
  our most esteemed photographists, show that your pages are the agreeable
  medium of publishing their researches. I would therefore respectfully
  suggest that you should yourself offer a prize for the best mode of
  making a good useful collodion, and that that prize should be a complete
  set of your valuable journal, which now, I believe, is progressing with
  its ninth volume. You might associate two independent names with your
  own, in testing the merits of any sample supplied to you, and a condition
  should be that the formula should be published in "N. &amp; Q." Your
  observations upon the manufacturers of paper, respecting the intrinsic
  value of a premium, are equally applicable to this proposition, because,
  should the collodion prepared by any of the various dealers who at
  present advertise in your columns be deemed to be the most satisfactory,
  your sanction and that of your friends alone would be an ample
  recompense. I would also suggest that samples sent to you should be
  labelled with a motto, and a corresponding motto, <i>sealed</i>, should
  contain the name and address, the name and address of the successful
  sample <i>alone</i> to be opened: this would effectually preclude all
  preconceived notions entertained by the testing manipulators who are to
  decide on the merits of what is submitted to them.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">A Reader of "N. &amp; Q." and a Photographer.</span></p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[We are obliged to our correspondent not only for the compliment he
  has paid to our services to photography, but also for his suggestion.
  There are many reasons, and some sufficiently obvious, why <i>we</i>
  should not undertake the task proposed; and there are as obvious reasons
  why it should be undertaken by the Photographic Society. That body has
  not only the means of securing the best judges of such matters, but an
  invitation from such a body would probably call into the field of
  competition all the best photographers, whether professional or
  amateur.]</p>

</div>

  <p><i>Double Iodide of Silver and Potassium.</i>&mdash;I shall feel
  greatly indebted to you, or to any correspondent of "N. &amp; Q.," for
  information as to the proportion of iodide of silver to the ounce of
  water, to be afterwards taken up by a <i>saturated solution</i> of iodide
  of potassium, and converted into the double iodide of silver and
  potassium.</p>

  <p>I generally pour all waste solution of silver into a jar of iodide of
  potassium solution; and last year, having washed some of the precipitated
  iodide of silver, I redissolved it in a solution of iodide of potassium
  of an unknown strength. Paper prepared with this solution answered very
  satisfactorily, kept well after excitation, and was very clear and
  intense; but this was purely accidental: and if you can tell me how to
  insure like success this summer, without a series of experiments, for
  which I have but little time just now, the information will be very
  acceptable to me, and probably to many others.</p>

  <p>I excite my paper with equal proportions of saturated solution of
  gallic acid and aceto-nitrate of silver, one or two drops of each to the
  drachm of distilled water. I always plunge the bottle of gallic acid
  solution into hot water when first made, which enables it to take up more
  of the acid; on cooling, the excess crystallises at the bottom. This
  ensures an even strength of solution: it will keep any length of time, if
  a small piece of camphor be allowed to float in it.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. W. Walrond.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Wellington.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The resultant iodide from fifteen grains of nitrate of silver,
  precipitated by means of the iodide of potassium, will give the requisite
  quantity of iodide for every ounce of water; or about twenty-seven grains
  of the dried iodide will produce the same effect. It is however far
  preferable, and more economical, to convert all waste into chloride of
  silver, from which the pure metal may be again so readily obtained.
  Iodide of silver, collected in the manner described by our correspondent,
  is very likely to lead to disappointment.]</p>

</div>

  <p><i>Albumenized Paper.</i>&mdash;I have by careful observation found
  that the cause of the albumen settling and drying in waving lines and
  blotches on my paper, arose from some parts of the paper being more
  absorbent than others, the gelatinous-like nature of the albumen
  assisting to retard its ready ingress into the unequal parts, and,
  consequently, that those places becoming the first dried, prevented the
  albumen, still slowly dripping over the now more wetted parts, from
  running down equally and smoothly, thereby causing a check to its
  progress; and as at last these become also dry, thicker and irregular
  patches of albumen were deposited, forming the mischief in question.</p>

  <p>The discovery of the cause suggested to me the propriety of either
  giving each sheet a prolonged floating of from ten to fifteen minutes on
  the salted albumen, or until every part had become fully and equally
  saturated; or, as a preliminary to the floating and hanging up by one
  corner on a line, of putting overnight between each sheet a damped piece
  of bibulous paper, and placing the whole between two smooth plates of
  stone, or other non-absorbent material.</p>

  <p>Either method produces equally good results; but I now always use the
  latter, thereby avoiding the necessity of otherwise having several dishes
  of albumen at work at once.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Henry H. Hele.</span></p>

  <p><i>Cyanide of Potassium</i> (Vol. ix., p. 230.).&mdash;I have for a
  long time been in the habit of using a solution of the above-named
  substance for fixing collodion <i>positives</i>, because the reduced
  silver has a much <i>whiter</i> appearance when thus fixed, than when the
  hyposulphite of soda is used for the same purpose; but I cannot quite
  agree with <span class="sc">Mr. Hockin</span> that it is <i>equally</i>
  applicable to negatives, though in many cases it will do very well. I
  find the reduced metal is more pervious to light when fixed with the
  cyanide solution, particularly in weak negatives. Lastly, I find that a
  small quantity of the <!-- Page 255 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page255"></a>{255}</span>silver salts being added to the solution
  before using, produces less injury to the half-tones, and this not by
  merely weakening the solution, as one of double the strength with the
  silver is better than one without it, though only half as powerful.</p>

  <p>Your correspondent C. E. F. (<i>ibid.</i>) will find his positives
  will not stand a saturated solution of hyposulphite of soda, unless he
  prints them so intensely dark that all traces of a picture by reflected
  light are obliterated; but I have sometimes accidentally exposed my
  positives a <i>whole day</i>, and retained a fair proof by soaking the
  apparently useless impressions in such a solution.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Saw-dust Recipe</i> (Vol. ix., p. 148.).&mdash;See Herschel's
  <i>Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy</i>, published in
  Lardner's <i>Cyclopædia</i>, p. 64., where he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That sawdust itself is susceptible of conversion into a substance
  bearing no remote analogy to bread; and though certainly less palatable
  than that of flour, yet no way disagreeable, and both wholesome and
  digestible, as well as highly nutritive."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>To which passage the following note is appended:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"See Dr. Prout's account of the experiments of Professor Autenrieth of
  Tubingen, <i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1827, p. 331. This discovery, which
  renders famine next to <i>impossible</i>, deserves a higher degree of
  celebrity than it has obtained."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author">J. M. W.</p>

  <p>Though not exactly the recipe for <i>saw-dust biscuits</i> which I
  have heard of, there is an account of the process of making bread from
  bark in Laing's "Norway" (Longman's <i>Traveller's Lib.</i>), part ii. p.
  219., where, on the subject of pine-trees, it is stated:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Many were standing with all their branches dead, stripped of the bark
  to make bread, and blanched by the weather, resembling white
  marble,&mdash;mere ghosts of trees. The bread is made of the inner rind
  next the wood, taken off in flakes like a sheet of foolscap paper, and is
  steeped or washed in warm water, to clear off its astringent principle.
  It is then hung across a rope to dry in the sun, and looks exactly like
  sheets of parchment. When dry it is pounded into small pieces mixed with
  corn, and ground into meal on the hand-mill or quern. It is much more
  generally used than I supposed. There are districts in which the forests
  suffered very considerable damage in the years 1812 and 1814, when bad
  crops and the war, then raging, reduced many to bark bread. The Fjelde
  bonder use it, more or less, every year. It is not very unpalatable; nor
  is there any good reason for supposing it unwholesome, if well prepared;
  but it is very costly. The value of the tree, which is left to perish on
  its root, would buy a sack of flour, if the English market were
  open."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now, if G. D., or any enterprising individual, could succeed in
  converting saw-dust into wholesome food, or fit for admixture with flour,
  somewhat after the above manner, it would indeed be a "happy discovery,"
  considering the present high price of "the staff of life." Bread has also
  been made from the horse-chesnut; but the expense of preparation,
  removing the strong bitter flavour, is no doubt the obstacle to its
  success. What could be done with the Spanish chesnut?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Willo.</span></p>

  <p>The saw-dust recipe is to be found in the <i>Saturday Magazine</i>,
  Jan. 3, 1835, taken from No. 104. of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>. It is
  entitled, "How to make a Quartern Loaf out of a Deal Board."</p>

  <p class="author">J. C.</p>

  <p>Your correspondent G. D. may find something to his purpose in a little
  German work, entitled <i>Wie kann man, bey grosser Theuerung und

  <p><i>Brydone the Tourist</i> (Vol. ix., p. 138.).&mdash;The literary
  world would feel obliged to <span class="sc">J. Macray</span> to tell us
  the name of the writer of the criticism who says, "Brydone never was on
  the Summit of Etna." Did the scholars of Italy know more of what was done
  by Englishmen in Sicily in Brydone's day than they do at present? How are
  the dates reconciled? Brydone would be 113 years old. Mr. Beckford, I
  think, must have been some thirteen or fourteen years younger. Brydone
  was always considered to be in his relations in life a man of probity and
  honour. I used to hear much of him from one nearly related to me, whose
  father was first cousin to Brydone's wife.</p>

  <p><i>Etymology of "Page"</i> (Vol. ix., p. 106.).&mdash;<i>Paggio</i>
  Italian, <i>page</i> French and Spanish, <i>pagi</i> Provençal, is

  >&pi;&alpha;&iota;&delta;&#x1F77;&omicron;&nu;</span>. This derivation is
  evidently the true one. I may take this opportunity of recommending the
  above-cited work to all persons who feel an interest in the etymology of

  <p><i>Longfellow</i> (Vol. ix., p. 174.).&mdash;There was a family of the
  name of Longfellow resident in Brecon, South Wales, about fifty or sixty
  years ago, who were large landowners in the county; and one of them (Tom
  Longfellow, alluded to in the lines below) kept the principal inn, "The
  Golden Lion," in that town. His son occupied a farm a few miles from
  Brecon, about thirty years ago; and two of his sisters resided in the
  town. The family was frequently engaged in law suits (perhaps from the
  <i>proverbially</i> litigious disposition <!-- Page 256 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page256"></a>{256}</span>of their Welsh
  neighbours), and was ultimately ruined. Many of the old inhabitants of
  that part of the Principality could, no doubt, give a better and fuller
  account of them.</p>

  <p>The following lines (not very flattering to the landlord, certainly),
  said to have been written by a commercial traveller on an inside-window
  shutter of "The Golden Lion," when Mr. Longfellow was the proprietor, may
  not be out of place in "N. &amp; Q.:"</p>

  <p>Yesterday I happened to be looking over an old Bristol paper (Sarah
  Farley's <i>Bristol Journal</i>, Saturday, June 11, 1791), and the name
  of Longfellow, which I had before only known as borne by the poet, caught
  my eye. At the end of the paper there is a notice in these words:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Advertisements are taken in for this paper by agents in various
  places, and by Mr. Longfellow, Brecon," &amp;c.</p>

  <p>There is now living at Beaufort Iron Works, Breconshire, a respectable
  tradesman, bearing the name of Longfellow. He himself is a native of the
  town of Brecon, as was his father also. But his grandfather was a
  settler; though from what part of the country this last-named relative
  originally came, he is unfortunately unable to say. He has the
  impression, however, that it was from Cornwall or Devonshire. Perhaps
  this information will partly answer the question of <span

  <p>It is by no means improbable that the name is a corruption of
  <i>Longvillers</i>, found in Northamptonshire as early as the reign of
  Edward I., and derived, I imagine, from the town of Longueville in
  Normandy. There is a Newton Longville in this county.</p>

  <p><i>Canting Arms</i> (Vol. ix., p. 146.).&mdash;The introduction to the

  <p><i>Holy Loaf Money</i> (Vol. ix., p. 150.).&mdash;At some time before
  the date of present rubrics, it was the custom for every house in the
  parish to provide in rotation bread (and wine) for the Holy Communion. By
  the first book of King Edward VI., this duty was devolved upon those who
  had the cure of souls, with a provision "that the parishioners of every
  parish should offer every Sunday, at the time of the offertory, <i>the
  just value and price of the holy loaf</i> ... to the use of the pastors
  and curates" who had provided it; "and that in such order and course as
  they were wont to find, and pay the said holy loaf." This is, I think,
  the correct answer to the Query of T.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;W.</p>

  <p><i>Mount Mill, and the Fortifications of London</i> (Vol. ix., p.
  174.).&mdash;B. R. A. Y. will find that the name is still applied to an
  obscure locality in the parish of St. Luke, situated close to the west
  end of Seward Street on the north side. The parliamentary fortifications
  of London are described in Maitland's <i>Hist.</i>, and Mount Mill is
  noticed in Cromwell's <i>Clerkenwell</i>, pp. 33. 396. This writer
  supposes that the <i>Mount</i> (long since levelled) originated in the
  interment of a great number of persons during the plague of 1665; but
  <!-- Page 257 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page257"></a>{257}</span>this, I think, is a mistake, for the Mount
  is mentioned in a printed broadside which, if I remember rightly, bears
  an earlier date. I cannot furnish its title, but it will be found in the
  British Museum, with the press-mark 669. f. 8/22. A plan of the city and
  suburbs, as fortified by order of the parliament in 1642 and 1643, was
  engraved by George Vertue, 1738; and a small plan of the same works
  appeared in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> a few years afterwards
  (1749?).</p>

  <p><i>Standing while the Lord's Prayer is read</i> (Vol. ix., p.
  127.).&mdash;A custom noted to prevail at Bristol: in connexion with it,
  it would be interesting to ascertain in what churches there still remain
  <i>any</i> usages of by-gone days, but which have generally got into
  desuetude. It is probable that in some one or other church there may
  still exist a usage handed down by tradition, which is not generally
  recognised nor authorised in the present day. Perhaps by means of our
  widely spread "N. &amp; Q.," and the notes of its able contributors, this
  may be ascertained. By way of example, and as a beginning, I would
  mention the following:&mdash;</p>

  <p>At St. Sampson's, Cricklade (it was so before 1820), the people say,
  "Thanks be to Thee, O God!" after the reading of the Gospel; a usage said
  to be as old as St. Chrysostom.</p>

  <p>At Talaton, Devon, where the congregation turn towards the singing
  gallery at the west end, during the singing of the "Magnificat" and other
  psalms, at the "Gloria" they all turn round to the <i>east</i>.</p>

  <p>At Bitton, Gloucestershire, two parishioners, natives of Lincolnshire,
  always gave me notice before they came to Holy Communion, as it was their
  <i>custom</i> always to do.</p>

  <p>When a boy, I remember an old gentleman, who came from one of the
  Midland Counties, always stood up at the "Glory" in the Litany. In many
  country churches, the old women make a courtesy.</p>

  <p>In many country churches, the old men bow and smooth down their hair
  when they enter the church; and women make a courtesy.</p>

  <p>In a late Number of your miscellany, you say it is a general practice
  for congregations in churches to <i>stand</i> during the reading of the
  Lord's Prayer, when it occurs in the order of Morning Lessons. In my
  experience, I do not remember any such custom prevalent in this part of
  the country; but may mention, as a curious and (as far as I know, or ever
  heard of) singular example of kneeling at the reading of St Matt. vi. and
  St. Luke xi., that at Formby, a retired village on the Lancashire coast,
  my first cure, the people observed this usage. The children in the
  schools were instructed to kneel whenever they read the section of these
  chapters which contains the Lord's Prayer. And at the "Burial of the
  Dead," as soon as the minister came to that portion of the ceremony where
  the use of the Lord's Prayer is enjoined, all the assembled mourners (old
  and young, and however cold or damp the day) would devoutly kneel down in
  the chapel yard, and remain in this posture of reverence until the
  conclusion of the service. I observed that their Roman Catholic
  neighbours, who often attended at funerals, when they happened to be
  present, did the same. So that it seemed to be "a tradition derived from
  their fathers," and handed down "from one generation to another."</p>

  <p class="author">R. L.</p>

  <p class="address">Great Lever, Bolton.</p>

  <p>This custom is observed in the Cathedral at Norwich, but not (I
  believe) in the other churches in that city. I remember seeing it noticed
  in a very old number of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, and should be
  glad if any of your correspondents could tell me which number it is. I
  have looked through the Index in vain. The writer denounced it as a
  <i>Popish</i> custom!</p>

  <p><i>A dead Sultan, with his Shirt for an Ensign</i> (Vol. ix., p.
  76.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr. Warden</span> will find a long and
  interesting description of Saladin in Knolles' <i>Turkish History</i>,
  pp. 33. 57., published in London by Adam Islip in 1603. I take from this
  learned work the following curious anecdote:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"About this time (but the exact period is not stated) died the great
  Sultan Saladin, the greatest terrour of the Christians; who, mindfull of
  man's fragilitie, and the vanitie of worldly honours, commanded at the
  time of his death no solemnitie to be vsed at his buriall, but only his
  shirt in manner of an ensigne, made fast vnto the point of a lance, to be
  carried before his dead bodie as an ensigne. A plaine priest going before
  and crying aloud vnto the people in this sort: '<i>Saladin Conquerour of
  the East, of all the greatnesse and riches hee had in this life, carrieth
  not with him after his death anything more than his shirt.</i>'"&mdash;"A
  sight (says Knolles) woorthie so great a king, as wanted nothing to his
  eternall commendation, more than the true knowledge of his salvation in
  Christ Jesu."</p>

  <p>"<i>Houd maet of laet</i>" (Vol. ix., p. 148.).&mdash;One of your
  correspondents desires an explanation of <i>this</i> phrase, which he
  found in the corner of an old Dutch picture. It is a Flemish proverb; I
  translate it thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Keep within bounds, though 'tis late."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It may either be the motto which the artist adopted to identify his
  work while he concealed <!-- Page 258 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page258"></a>{258}</span>his name; or it may be descriptive of the
  picture, which then would be an illustration of <i>this</i> proverb.
  Inscribed either by the artist himself, or by some officious person, who
  thus "tacked the moral full in sight."</p>

  <p>I think I have seen a similar inscription somewhere in Flanders on an
  antique drinking-cup, a very appropriate place for such wholesome
  counsel.</p>

  <p>I should like to know the subject of the picture your correspondent
  refers to. In modern Dutch the proverb reads thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Houd maat of laat."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">E. F. Woodman.</span></p>

  <p>The above Dutch proverb means, in English:</p>

  <p><i>Captain Eyre's Drawings</i> (Vol. ix., p. 207.).&mdash;The mention
  of Captain Eyre's drawings of the Fortifications in London, and the
  editorial note appended thereto, remind me of an inquiry I have long been
  desirous of making respecting the curious, if authentic, drawings by this
  same Captain Eyre, illustrative of Shakspeare's residence in London,
  described in one of your earlier volumes (Vol. vii., p. 545.). I have not
  myself had an opportunity of consulting Mr. Halliwell's first volume, but
  a friend who looked at it for me says he could not find any account of
  them there. In whose possession are they now?</p>

  <p><i>Sir Thomas Browne and Bishop Ken</i> (Vol. ix., p. 220.).&mdash;Had

  volume of "N. &amp; Q." (Vol. viii., p. 10.), he would have seen that the
  "coincidences" between these writers had been already noticed in your
  pages by one of the bishop's biographers.</p>

  <p>The life of Ken, from the pen of your correspondent, is omitted in
  <span class="sc">Mr. Mackenzie Walcott's</span> list, and may be equally
  unknown to that gentleman as the note before mentioned; but in the
  <i>Quarterly Review</i> (vol. lxxxix. p. 278.), and in many pages of Mr.

  appears to us impossible to produce instruments of the same size
  possessing a richer and finer tone, more elastic touch, or more equal
  temperament, while the elegance of their construction renders them a
  handsome ornament for the library, boudoir, or drawing-room. (Signed)

  <p>The SCALE OF PREMIUMS adopted by this Office will be found of a very
  moderate character, but at the same time quite adequate to the risk
  incurred.</p>

  <p>FOUR-FIFTHS, or 80 per cent. of the Profits, are assigned to Policies
  <i>every fifth year</i>, and may be applied to increase the sum insured,
  to an immediate payment in cash, or to the reduction and ultimate
  extinction of future Premiums.</p>

  <p>ONE-THIRD of the Premium on Insurances of 500<i>l.</i> and upwards,
  for the whole term of life, may remain as a debt upon the Policy, to be
  paid off at convenience; or the Directors will lend sums of 50<i>l.</i>
  and upwards, on the security of Policies effected with this Company for
  the whole term of life, when they have acquired an adequate value.</p>

  <p>SECURITY.&mdash;Those who effect Insurances with this Company are
  protected by its Subscribed Capital of 750,000<i>l.</i>, of which nearly
  140,000<i>l.</i> is invested, from the risk incurred by Members of Mutual
  Societies.</p>

  <p>The satisfactory financial condition of the Company, exclusive of the
  Subscribed and Invested Capital, will be seen by the following
  Statement:</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Acrostic." title="Acrostic.">
